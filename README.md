# iPhoneRingToneMaker

## Overview

iPhoneRingToneMaker is an application created in C# to take file and convert it into a valid iPhone ringtone.

Currently it will only support downloading a song from youtube and turning it into a ring tone, but I hope to be able to convert other formats into ringtones at some point.

## Features

### YouTube converter

iPhoneRingToneMaker takes a specified YouTube video, downloads it and converts it into an aac format.

## Requirements
 •	.NET Framework 4.0
 •	[YouTubeExtractor](https://github.com/flagbug/YoutubeExtractor) developed by [flagbug](https://github.com/flagbug)
 
## Development

iPhoneRingToneMaker is currently in a very early stage of development and has to be compiled from the source code, at the moment it doesnt have most of the functionality.
